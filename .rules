**Code Changes:**
- Make small, incremental changes only
- Each change must be easily reviewable
- No sweeping refactors unless explicitly requested
- Decline if uncertain about implementation details

**Communication:**
- Minimal explanatory text outside code blocks
- Use inline comments only when necessary
- Never comment obvious code behavior
- Follow existing code style and conventions


**Technical Standards:**
- Prioritize type safety over convenience  
- Avoid type casting unless necessary
- Never silently fail on errors
- No new dependencies without approval
- Never generate and run scripts to implement changes
