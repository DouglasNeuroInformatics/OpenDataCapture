When debugging, it’s important to distinguish between **client-side errors** (errors in the user’s browser) and **server-side errors** (errors from your backend services). Client-side issues appear in the browser console, while server-side issues are recorded by your running containers.

### Client Logs

To inspect client-side errors and warnings, open your browser’s developer tools and check the **Console** tab.

### Server Logs

Server logs are available through Docker. For example, you can view logs for a specific service with:

```bash
docker compose logs api
```

The API and Gateway logs are in JSON format, so you can filter and inspect them using jq. For example, to show only error-level logs from the last 24 hours:

```bash
docker compose logs api --no-log-prefix --since 24h | jq 'select(.level == "ERROR")'
```

### Reporting Issues
