There are two ways to create and test an instrument:

- **Instrument Playground**: create, validate, and upload your instrument in the browser.
- **Local Development (CLI)**: run an instrument folder on your machine using `@opendatacapture/serve-instrument`.

## Instrument Playground (Recommended)

### Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Open Instrument Playground**

    First, navigate to the [Instrument Playground](https://playground.opendatacapture.org/) and create your instrument. You can verify that your instrument works as expected in the right panel.

2.  **Select the Upload Bundle Button**

    Once you are satisfied with your instrument, click the menu button on the top right corner and then select the "Upload Bundle" tab.

3.  **Complete the Upload Bundle Form**

    Finally, fill out the required form and click submit to upload your instrument.

## Local Development (CLI)

To use the CLI you must have **Node.js** installed on your machine.

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g @opendatacapture/serve-instrument
```

Then run it against your instrument folder containing an entrypoint (index.tsx, index.jsx, index.ts, index.js):

```bash
serve-instrument ./path/to/instrument
```

The server watches the instrument directory and rebuilds automatically when files change (refresh the browser to load the latest bundle).
