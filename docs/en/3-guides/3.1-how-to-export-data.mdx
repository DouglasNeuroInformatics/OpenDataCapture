Open Data Capture allows you to download data on demand, either in JSON format or an ultra-wide CSV. When downloading a CSV, a README.txt file is downloaded that includes documentation for the format.

### Steps

<Steps>

1.  **Login to Open Data Capture**

    First, login to your instance of Open Data Capture. In order to visualize subject data, you must have adequate permissions. Usually, that means you must be a group manager (or equivalent).
