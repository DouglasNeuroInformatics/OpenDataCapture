### Applications

The outreach website and playground are not relevant to the general functionality of the platform as such and are
not discussed further. The other three components are independent of each other, in so far as they could be replaced
with an alternative providing equivalent interfaces without impacting the functioning of other services.

### Internal Packages

Within the `packages` directory, there are a variety of different internal packages. A given package may
depend on one or more other internal packages, which is indicated in the `package.json` file located in the
root of the directory for that package.

### Databases

Open Data Capture uses two databases:

1. A MongoDB database (also referred to as "Core Database")
2. An SQLite database (also referred to as "Gateway Database")

Predictably, the Core Database is used to store almost all application data and is accessed exclusively
by the Core API, while the Gateway Database is used to store encrypted data stored on the gateway.

In both cases, schemas are defined using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) and stored in the `packages/prisma-client`
folder. This package exports both schemas, which can later be consumed by the appropriate application. The purpose of
this setup is to allow other libraries to consume the autogenerated type definitions for the database schemas, as
well as to prevent clashing between the different Prisma clients in `node_modules`.
