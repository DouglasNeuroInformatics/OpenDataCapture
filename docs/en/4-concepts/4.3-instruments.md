### What is an Instrument?

Central to Open Data Capture is the concept of an instrument. Conceptually, an instrument is any tool that can be used to collect data. This can range from simple forms (e.g., a questionnaire assessing depressive symptoms) to complex interactive tasks (e.g., the Stroop Task).

Technically, an _Instrument_ is a just a [JavaScript Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), which is composed of a key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary in Python. These objects define the properties of an instrument, such as the content to be displayed by the user (e.g., the fields of a form).

### Instrument Bundle (I)

In Open Data Capture, Instruments are almost always generated from an _Instrument Bundle_. An Instrument Bundle is [JavaScript expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) that resolves to a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/J) of an Instrument. For example, supposing that an Instrument included only a name, the following would be an example of an Instrument Bundle:

```javascript
const instrumentBundle = "Promise.resolve({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' });";
const instrument = await eval(instrumentBundle);
console.log(instrument.name); // 'Simplified Instrument'
```

### Instrument Sources

In practice, these bundles are seldom written directly by end users. Instead, they are generated by the _Bundler_ from _Instrument Sources_, which are the files that define an instrument. These files are stored in a directory, which must include an index file. This serves as the entry point for the instrument and must include a default export that defines the instrument

To resolve the index file, the bundler checks for the following file names (in order):

- `index.tsx`
- `index.jsx`
- `index.ts`
- `index.js`

If none of these files exist, the Bundler throws an exception.

In many cases, _Instrument Sources_ may include one an index file. For example, if we convert the previous example to _Instrument Sources_:

**index.js**

```javascript
export default Promise.resolve({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' });
```

### Instrument Bundle (II)

From these sources, the Bundler generates a single asynchronous [Immediately Invoked Function Expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). This output conforms to the [ECMAScript 2022 Language Specification](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/) and can be executed in any modern browser.

For example, the Bundler might generate the following output:

```javascript
"(async () => ({ name: 'Simplified Instrument' }))();";
```
